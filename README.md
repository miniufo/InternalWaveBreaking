# InternalWaveBreaking

![Animation](./Data/panel2.gif)


## 1. Introduction
This is a idealized simulation of internal wave breaking due to tide-topography interaction based on [MITgcm](http://mitgcm.org/).  Left shows the isopycnals, middle is the local available potential energy (APE) and right is the local diapycnal diffusivity.
