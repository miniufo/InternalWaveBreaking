# InternalWaveBreaking

![Animation](./Data/panel2.gif)


## 1. Introduction
This is a idealized simulation of internal wave breaking due to tide-topography interaction based on [MITgcm](http://mitgcm.org/).  Left shows the isopycnals, middle is the local available potential energy [APE, ([Roullet and Klein 2009](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/available-potential-energy-diagnosis-in-a-direct-numerical-simulation-of-rotating-stratified-turbulence/906E71577A230B90B48D8CEB442EE873); [Winters and Barkan 2013](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/available-potential-energy-density-for-boussinesq-fluid-flow/563B240B07CEBFDCD68F77A78FBFED16))] and right is the local diapycnal diffusivity.
